Daily Coding Problem for May 25 2019

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You have n fair coins and you flip them all at the same time. 
Any that come up tails you set aside. The ones that come up heads 
you flip again. How many rounds do you expect to play before only one coin remains?

Write a function that, given n, returns the number of rounds you'd
expect to play until one coin remains.

Given:
n fair coins are flipped

Initial thought:
From probability, we know that the expected value of
flipping n coins is given by this formula:
E[X] = n*.5 Where X is the random number of coins that turn up heads
