Summary:

Combining the forces of mathematics and computer science,
i was able to apply a simple formulat to get the total number of 
rounds it would take to reduce a number of coins to 1 through
elimination. The main method of operation was to just keep 
dividing n by 2 until it equals 1 and keep the number of times 
n was divided.

Lesson1: Knowing mathematical principles is very helpful with 
these kind of problems

Final Thoughts:
It would probably be wise to invest in learning more mathematics and 
logic to ameliorate the way I tackle some programming problems.
I.E. give my brute force intuition some mathematical/logical wisdom
