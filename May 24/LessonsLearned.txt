Summary:

Basically, there is one big loop, which branches
out into smaller loops where need be.  Going about this with
finite state machine mindset really help shape the loops.
According to the rules of a scientific notation, you can't have 
a decimal in the exponent.  I didn't consider having an exponent 
that was also in scientific notatation.  I allowed for answers such as 
10. and .0 to remain, because they are technially valid decimals, which are
valid rationals.

Lesson1: Sometimes the brute force is the only force

Final Thoughts:
Although this implementation gets the job done, I think there
is places where the workload could be redone.  For example, I realized that 
if first element is a '-', all we have to really do is just start the main loop 
at index 1 instead of zero and just keep a note that the answer will be negative.
