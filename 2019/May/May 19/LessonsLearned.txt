Summary:

It's evident that the merge sort was the way to go
for this problem.  I was having trouble with the algorithm, 
but after I made it more granular, it worked smoother.  

Lesson1: For merge sort, there is always 1 base case:
that of the unit array, which has only one element. 
Lesson2: With the granularization of the mergeSort algorithm,
it gives a flexibility with manipulation the value of the data
held in an index. But, this doesn't impact the sorting because 
it is pre-emptive to the actual sorting and merging.

Final Thoughts:
Stick to a very granular algorithm.  Then you can manipulate
to your hearts content.
