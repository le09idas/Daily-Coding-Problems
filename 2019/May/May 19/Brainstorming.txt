Daily Coding Problem for May 19 2019

Asked by Google:

Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements
and give the output in sorted order.

For example, given [-9,-2,0,2,3], return 
[0,4,4,9,81]

Given:
list is sorted already
values are only integers

Initial thought:
maybe we need to tweak a normal merge sort algorithm
maybe just replace the items with absolute value and reorder and square values
