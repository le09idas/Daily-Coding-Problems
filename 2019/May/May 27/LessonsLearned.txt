Summary:

This seemed a little too easy, but sometimes
prompts like these are.  All that needed to be
done was to have two loops, one to copy each item
being rotated to the rear and one to move all the 
following elements up towards the head of the list.
To make things general, I use an Object array 
allowing for various items of various types to 
be able to be input

Lesson1: K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid) 
Lesson2: For lists that need to be substantially
modified, two loops are necessary to get things done
Lesson3: The Object class is very versatile

Final Thoughts:
The Object class is very useful for situations
where the types of objects are not necessarily known.
Although doable in Java, it would appear to be more 
elegantly handled in Python.
