Daily Coding Problem for <Month> <day> <year>

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest 
distance (measured in number of words) between any 
two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" 
and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog 
hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one 
word "cat" in between the two words.
