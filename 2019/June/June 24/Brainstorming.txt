This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack API using only a heap. 
A stack implements the following methods:

push(item), which adds an element to the stack
pop(), which removes and returns the most recently 
added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap
