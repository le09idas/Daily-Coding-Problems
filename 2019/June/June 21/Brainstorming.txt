Daily Coding Problem for <Month> <day> <year>

Given a 2-D matrix representing an image, a 
location of a pixel in the screen and a color C, 
replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent 
same colored pixels with C.

For example, given the following matrix, and location 
pixel of (2, 2), and 'G' for green:

B B W
W W W
W W W
B B B
Becomes

B B G
G G G
G G G
B B B

Given:
2-D array
target pixel

Initial thought:
So we do the following:
note the color of the pixel at the give coordinate
do a breadth search on surronding idices for similar colored pixels
change the colors after visiting each one.
