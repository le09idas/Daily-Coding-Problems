Given a list of points, a central point, 
and an integer k, find the nearest k points 
from the central point.

For example, given the list of points [(0, 0), (5, 4), (3, 1)], 
the central point (1, 2), and k = 2, return [(0, 0), (3, 1)].

Given:
A point
A distance from that point

Initial thought:
So it seems that it would be good enough to do this:
set a list of k coordinates. 
interate through the list looking for the closest point
put that point at the front of the list
repeat k - 1 more times, skipping the first idices which 
were already switched out for the minimum.
