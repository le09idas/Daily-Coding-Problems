Daily Coding Problem for <Month> <day> <year>

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts.

The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x
The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x
The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x
Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.

For example, given x = 10 and lst = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10], one partition may be [9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14].

Given:
<list of variables and 
considerations for the 
problem>

Initial thought:
<the first idea that comes 
to mind when thinking about tackling
the above problem>
