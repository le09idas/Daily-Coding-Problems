Daily Coding Problem for June 2 2019

This question was asked by Riot Games.

Design and implement a HitCounter class
that keeps track of requests, or hits.  
It should support the following operations:

-record(timestamp):
records a hit that happened at timestamp
-total():
returns the total number of hits
recorded
range(lower, upper):
returnst the number of hits that
occurred between timestamps lower
and upper (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has 
limited memory.

Given:
schematic for HitCounter class

Initial thought:
Use an arraylist of timestamps to hold all
the hits; this by default allows it to have
a size which can be used to get the total number of 
hits; also, we can choose which index to show
the hit for with a linear search.
