Daily Coding Problem for June 5 2019

This question was asked by Apple.

Given a binary tree, find a minimum path 
sum from root to a leaf.

For example, the minimum path in this 
tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

  10
 /  \
5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1

Given:
Binary Tree

Initial thought:
Brute force would dicatate to get every path and 
log the sum then determine which one is 
the least. 

The tree doesn't seem to be balanced so this creates 
quite the task to accomplish.
