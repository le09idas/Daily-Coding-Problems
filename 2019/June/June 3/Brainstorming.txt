Daily Coding Problem for June 3 2019

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary search
tree, return the next bigger element, also 
known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.
        10
       /  \
      5   30
         /  \
        22  35

You can assume each node has a parent pointer.

Given:
A single node in a tree
Each node points to its parent

Initial thought:
It seems the best option would be to first check the
right child recursively.  If all of the nodes encountered
are null, check the parent, if the parent is null return
