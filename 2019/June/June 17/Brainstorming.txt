Given a list, sort it using this method: reverse(lst, i, j), which reverses lst from i to j.

Given:
a list and two indices

Initial thought:
I am thinking that all that really needs to be 
done is for two pointers to reference the first and last
items in the sublist and switch them in the list, then 
get closer to the middle value(s) of the sublist.

what could be done is to extract the sublist from the main
list temporarily

when the sublist is extracted, we can pop each piece off
and have them point to the previously popped piece
(the first one will have to be made a ptr)

after the list is reversed, we count back to the position
before the sublist make the previously use pointer the next item
then traverse that sublist and connect that last node to the 
index after the end of the substring.
