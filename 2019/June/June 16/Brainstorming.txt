Daily Coding Problem for June 16 2019

his question was asked by BufferBox.

Given a binary tree where all nodes are either 
0 or 1, prune the tree so that subtrees containing 
all 0s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0
should be pruned to:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    /
   1

We do not remove the tree at the root or its 
left child because it still has a 1 as a descendant.


Given:
A binary binary tree

Initial thought:
We will definitely be able to use recursion 
to get what we need done.  All we have to do is descend into the 
tree and remove any zero children that have not children.
