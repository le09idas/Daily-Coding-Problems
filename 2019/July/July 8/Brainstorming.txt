Daily Coding Problem for July 8 2019

Difficulty: Medium

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]

you should return:

[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]

Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?

Given:
A square matrix

Initial thought:
The obvious way would be to make a blank matrix and rotate
each item in the current array to it's final rotated position.

Taking a pointer from linear algebra and matrices in general,
we merely need to take each row and make it the new column starting from 
the higher addresses of each row.

But now what if we can't use any extra space?
