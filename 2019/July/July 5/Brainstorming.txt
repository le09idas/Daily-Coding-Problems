This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers, return a new array where 
each element in the new array is the number of smaller 
elements to the right of that element in the original input array.

For example, given the array [3, 4, 9, 6, 1], return [1, 1, 2, 1, 0], since:

There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3
There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4
There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9
There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6
There are no smaller elements to the right of 1

Given:
List of integers

Initial thought:
The solution here seems to be the brute force
approach.  For each index, we enter a secondary loop 
to count each lower integer and then at the end set 
the index to that number.
