Summary:

The basic idea is that we traverse the given array
from every index to the end.  On each iteration, we
keep track of how many integers are less than the current
index's value.  After we get to the end of the list each time,
we replace the value of the array with how many integers are
less than the current index's value.

Lesson1: Brute force may sometimes be the only option

Final Thoughts:
Even though there are two loops, the time it takes this
program to complete is always going to be less than 
n^2.  It may be closer to (n^2)/2.
