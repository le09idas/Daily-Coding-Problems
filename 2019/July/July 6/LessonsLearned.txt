Summary:

Used an inner pointer class for the iterator
to keep track of what the next item to return was.
Invoking next() simply moves the ptr up the ladder
to the next item to return. has_next() merely faints
a move to see if there are any more items left.

Lesson1: It appears that checking in descending order of object level is always
beneficient; i.e., it's better to start checking the actual list before its indices
Lesson2:Inner classes are nice to have but sometimes can be replaced by more simple
means of manipulating data

Final Thoughts:
It was nice to stretch my legs with the usage of an inner class.  It was smooth to 
work with and really helped keep the code clearer in the main area of logic of next().
The hardest parts of problems like these isn't the actual method with which to extract 
the information but actually traversing the arrays and finding the proper timing when it
comes to returning the information desired.
