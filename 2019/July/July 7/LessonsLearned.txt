Summary:

There are a couple of things that needed to be
done: 1) make the palindrome function, 2) make
a function to travers a list of strings and return
the valid pair combinations

Lesson1: When you're gonna use inner class, you can use them with static methods
Lesson2: It seems that with any palindrome problem, brute force is usually the way to go

Final Thoughts:
Palindromes are very curious because they demand the need to use greedy algorithms to verify their 
existence.  However, with some tinkering, i.e., checking if a pair can be combined in two ways with 
a single visit, can cut the already taxing runtime in half.
