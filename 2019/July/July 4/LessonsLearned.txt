Summary:

For a given array of size n, a boolean list 
was created with the same size.  Each element was
set to false.  We iterate through the given array of 
integers.  Since all numbers between 1 and n will be given,
we set the number index of the boolean list that is the same 
as the current integer in the current index of the boolean list as true.
If we get a number which requires that it be mapped to an index in the 
boolean list that is already set to true, we have found our duplicate.

Lesson1: This dictionary like design is very powerful and efficiently uses the space given
to increase the speed

Final Thoughts:
This is certainly a case where the dictionary works wonders.  With a little
investment of space the runtime certainly improves.
