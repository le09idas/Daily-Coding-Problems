Daily Coding Problem for July 4 2019

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of length n + 1 
whose elements belong to the set {1, 2, ..., n}. 
By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. 
Find it in linear time and space.

Given:
Array of integers

Initial thought:
My thought is to set up a list which is empty.
Then assign each element to a spot in the list. If we 
encounter a situation where we're adding an element to an
index that is already filled, we have found our duplicate.

Since all integers 1 to n are included, we just have to make 
the array (which can be boolean valued initialized to all false) 
of size n.
