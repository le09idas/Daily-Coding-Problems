This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Given an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation, 
write a program to evaluate it.

The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. 
For example: [5, 3, '+'] should return 5 + 3 = 8.

For example, [15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-'] 
should return 5, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.

You can assume the given expression is always valid.

Given:
Items organized in reverse Polish notation
