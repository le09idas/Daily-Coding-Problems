Daily Coding Problem for May 20 2019

Asked by Google:

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of
numbers that covers all the intervals.  If there are multiple 
smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals
[0,3], [2,6], [3,4], [6,9], one set of 
numbers that covers all these intervals {3,6}

Given:
list of  interval pairs

Questions:
Are we only counting  the end points or numbers in between, i.e.
is {3, 7} a valid answer?
Can a single point be an integer? i.e. [1,1]

Initial thought:
The brute force way would be to make all possible sets 
of numbers and then test each, from the smallest sets first,
and see if the number(s) cover the intervals.

Simplify the problem:
say we start with a list of intervals of size one;
i.e. [0,3].  Int this case the total number of solutions is
3: {0}, {3}, {0,3}.  From the constraints of the problem,
{0} or {3} are possible solutions. When we get two intervals,
i.e [0,3], [2,6]. We note that for any interval, 2 out of 3 of the number
of possible  sets ar  the smallest and able to cover the interval.
