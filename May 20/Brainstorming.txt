Daily Coding Problem for May 20 2019

Asked by Google:

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of
numbers that covers all the intervals.  If there are multiple 
smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals
[0,3], [2,6], [3,4], [6,9], one set of 
numbers that covers all these intervals {3,6}

Given:
list of  interval pairs

Questions:
Are we only counting the end points or numbers in between, i.e.
is {3, 7} a valid answer?
Can a single integer be a point? i.e. [1,1]

Initial thought:
The brute force way would be to make all possible sets 
of numbers and then test each, from the smallest sets first,
and see if the number(s) cover the intervals.

Let's say we start with just one interval, let's say [0,3].

The possible answers are {0} and {3}, which by the premise
of the question, are valid options.  Now let's say we have
2 intervals: [0,3], [2,6].

The answer here could be {0, 2}, {0, 6}, {3, 2}, or {3, 6}.

Now with 3 intervals: [0,3], [2,6], [3,4].
The possible solutions are:
{3, 2} and {3, 6}. (but if we aren't counting only endpoints, 
answer could be {3})

There is still no apparent pattern. Maybe if we visualize it differently.

Maybe by actually lining them up next to each other:

[0,3] ._._._. . . . . . .
[2,6] . . ._._._._. . . .
[3,4] . . . ._. . . . . .
[6,9] . . . . . . ._._._.
