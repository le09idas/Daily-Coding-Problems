Daily Coding Problem for May 30 2019

Given a real number n, find the square
root of n. For example, gvien n=9, return
3.

Given:
A real number

Assumed:
these values are positive (can't square a negative)

Initial thought:
Let's reduce this to finding the square root
of all positive integers and 0.  All i would have to do is 
start form zero and see which one squared equals the target value.
However, not every integer will be covered.  We will have to find 
real numbers that multiply out to them.
